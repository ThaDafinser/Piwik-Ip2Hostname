# Piwik Ip2Hostname Plugin

## Description

This plugin (try) to get the hostname of the visitor and write it into the `log_visitor` table.

There are currently ***no reports or any views available***, to see a result. 
I currently dont have the time and need of such a view, and therefor maybe you'll never see one...if nobody else create oen :-)

NOTE:
I use it in an intranet to detect computers which have old enviroment, because the IP might change i log the hostname.

I never tried it and probably wont use it for internet...
